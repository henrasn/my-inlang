      "1_content": "<p>Experience the sensation of staying at Bobopod! We offer not only comfort but also the advancement of technology and security. Bobopod can be one of the best solutions to enjoy your travel and have a quality rest, perfect for holidays or business travels. At Bobopod, you can listen to your favorite tunes and set the mood by adjusting the lamp color. The security of the pods is at our utmost importance. Bobopod uses QR code that can only be accessed via Bobobox’s apps on your smartphone. As one of the most affordable accommodations in Bandung, Bobopod can be a smart choice to have a memorable traveling moment with your family and closed ones. You can have some insta-worthy selfies and share your experience through social media at Bobopod because we are instagrammable! So, have you booked your stay at Bobopod yet?<\/p>",
      "2_title": "Sophisticated capsule hotel",
      "2_content": "<p>Capsule hotels usually consist of small rooms built inside a building. This is not the case with Bobopod because we offer a different experience of staying in a capsule hotel. Here, your privacy will be protected because every pod is facilitated with a door with a QR code lock that can only be accessed through Bobobox’s apps on your smartphone. <br>For sure, this is something that separates Bobopod with the other capsule hotels which mostly depend on drapes for privacy. Bobopod also has other smart features on our apps. From check-in to check-out, you can use the apps as a smart key and remote control to change the mood lamp’s colors. <br>The spacious pod features a central AC, cool enough so you can have a comfortable rest even though you’re not staying at a 5-star hotel. You can also keep your belongings inside the pod so you don’t have to worry about them when you travel. Your shoes will also be safe inside the special locker.<\/p>",
      "3_title": "Smart accommodation for smart travelers",
      "3_content": "<p>Bobopod is a capsule hotel in Indonesia that puts forward modern technology. You can book a pod through Bobobox’s website and apps. After booking, you can make your payment automatically using several payment methods.  <br>After that, you can get a QR code on Bobobox’s apps and it can be used as a smart key to enter your pod without using a regular key. Using Bobobox’s app, you can control the LED lamps inside the pod and set them to your mood.<\/p>",
      "4_title": "Shared living concept",
      "4_content": "<p>If you really like sipping a cup of coffee while chilling out or working, Bobopod has a communal area with a dependable Wi-Fi connection so your activities will not be disturbed. Of course, with a more affordable price than 5-star hotels, you can save some money to press your traveling budget so you can experience more! You will enjoy your vacation or staycation to the fullest! <br>Another thing to note is that staying in a capsule hotel will introduce you to a shared living concept. As a guest, you will have to be a “good neighbor”. It means that you have to be considerate with others in terms of noise and follow the rules that we have. Bobopod has quiet hours from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. to make sure that all guests have a peaceful rest. Also, you are not allowed to bring food inside the pod to keep it clean for other guests to use. But, worry not! We have a pantry and communal area for you to have your meal. <br>Enjoy many benefits of staying at Bobopod. You can get affordable accommodation, new friends, great facilities, and lots and lots of cool selfies!<\/p>",
      "5_title": "Seamless in all aspects",
      "5_content": "<p>With a price lower than 200 thousand rupiahs on weekdays, you will be pampered with an instagrammable, unique, and also comfortable.

Also, make sure you have downloaded our apps so that you can have a seamless check-in process.<\/p>",
      "6_title": "Safe and reliable facilities",
      "6_content": "<p>Even though Bobopod is a capsule hotel, it fits for two people so you can sleep with you loved one or your friend inside the pod. The room is spacious and you won’t feel trapped or suffocated. Inside the pod, we also have a central AC with adjustable temperature so you can enjoy a quality rest. All of the assumptions of being in a small capsule hotel will vanish when you try Bobopod’s pod. <br>Something that is considered important for travelers when they stay at an accommodation is the cleanliless of the bathrooms and toilets. In the eyes of the guests, the cleanliness and comfort of the bathroom are some of the main concerns, besides the price. <br>At Bobopod, it has become our priority to take care of the cleanliless of our bathrooms and toilets. Our cleaners will always make sure that all bathrooms are maintained and cleaned. Even though the bathrooms are shared, we will make sure that we give you the facilities and service that other big hotels can. You can have a look at our pods and facilities on our official Instagram account, <a href='https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bobobox_id' target='_blank rel='noreferrer norel>@bobobox_id<\/a>. We look forward to greeting you at our pods!<\/p>"
